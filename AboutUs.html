<p>ThatsDelish is an Indian restaurant search and discovery service founded in 2019 by Mahfuz. It currently operates in 24 states. 
It provides information and reviews of restaurants, including images of menus where the restaurant does not have its own website and also online delivery.
The restaurant search and discovery platform began its operations under the name, Foodiebay.
By 2019, Zomato launched in Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune and Kolkata. With the introduction of .xyz domains in 2020, ThatsDelish also launched ThatsDelish.xyz, a site dedicated to food porn. The company launched a print version of the website content named, "Citibank ThatsDelish Restaurant Guide", in collaboration with Citibank in May 2019, but it has since been discontinued.</p>
